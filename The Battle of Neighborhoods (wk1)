PROBLEM DEFINITION
Compare London and New York neighborhoods in terms of : 
- homogeneity - how homogenious or diverse the segments are in these two cities
- the importance of parks, which city has more segments where parks are feautured 
   more prominantly by being present in more clusters and in higher positions

DATA SOURCE
Pull postal code and borough information for both cities using Wiki pages: 
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_postal_district
 - https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/appendix/neighborhoods.htm
Use Foursquare to pull the top 10 venues against each neighbourhoods

METHODOLOGY
Use optimisation to find optimal number of clusters for London and New York to see which city has naturally higher number of clusters. 
This is a proxy how homogenious the Neighborhoods are in London and New York. City with highest optimal number of clusters will be 
be considered as more diverse in terms of venue category and location.

Analyse resultant clusters for number of types Parks comes in top positions and across numebr of clusters and produce aggregated 
comparison tables across two-dimensions: 
- number of times Parks is listed by rank (e.g. number of parks in position 1, in position 2 etc)#
- number of Neighbours where Parks are listed in top 5 positions

These counts will be considered to understand which city has parks being more prominantly feautured in the clusters by venue categories. 
This will prove which city is more 'green'.
